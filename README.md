Snippets of Ohm-JS code for various source-to-source transformations (transpilation).

Using Ohm-JS as a bulk editor instead of as a compiler-generating tool.

See run.bash.

- PFR is a command-line tool based on Ohm-JS and Glue.
- Glue is a code generator for the semantic code for Ohm-JS parsers.

## Glue

Glue uses JavaScript template strings at its core. Glue simply generates strings - nothing else (no ASTs, etc.).

Glue seems extremely simple-minded on the surface, but it can be used in many pattern-matching scenarios, like REGEXP is used in many pattern-matching situation.

[REGEXP came out of the compiler world, too].

Ohm-JS is a variant of PEG. PEG is more powerful than REGEXP.

Ohm's Editor is a break-through in grammar debugging.
